## Trying to make an custom crypto wallet

1. currently a basic prototype is ready
2. we can send transaction using private key and also check wallet balaance but
3. it doesn't have the feature to create an account it curently just interact with an created wallet
4. Runs as an extension

put "0x" before both private key and address when using this
